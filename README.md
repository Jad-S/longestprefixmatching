# longestprefixmatching
This program uses the Longest Prefix Match algorithm, which determines where to forward a packet once it has arrived to a router. It simulates this packet-forwarding behaviour and returns the interfaces used for each IP address, which corresponds to their appearance in the IPAddresses input file. (e.g. First outputted interfaces matches first ip address, etc..)

* Note: If you want to use your own input, refer to the RoutingTable.txt file to input your own routing table
and the DestinationIPAddresses.txt file to add the IP Addresses of your choice, both files can be found under CSCI3171/A5.
