# longestprefixmatching
This program uses the Longest Prefix Match algorithm, which determines where to forward a packet once it has arrived to a router. It simulates this packet-forwarding behaviour and returns the interfaces used for each IP address, which corresponds to their appearance in the IPAddresses input file. (e.g. First outputted interfaces matches first ip address, etc..)
